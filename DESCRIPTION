Description: "Multiscale Graph Correlation" MGC is a framework that extends global correlation procedures to be multiscale; consequently, MGC tests typically require far fewer samples than existing methods for a wide variety of dependence structures and dimensionalities, while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, MGC provides a simple and elegant multiscale characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry underlying the relationship.
